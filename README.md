## 💡 The Pitch
I didn't just want to clone the layout; I wanted to clone the **experience**. This project focuses on the tactile feel of the UI—the "Antigravity" hover effects, the seamless transitions, and the instant responsiveness effectively recreating the premium feel of a top-tier streaming service. Built on the bleeding edge of **Next.js 16** and **React 19**, I designed it to be fast, fluid, and cinematic.

## ✨ Key Features
- **🚀 Antigravity UI**: I engineered custom CSS animations for weightless card scaling and reveals.
- **📽️ Immersive Hero Section**: Video backgrounds with gradient overlays for a cinematic start.
- **⚡ Instant Interactivity**: Global state management with **Zustand** for instant "My List" toggles and modal opens.
- **📱 Fluid Responsiveness**: A mobile-first design that scales perfectly from phone to 4K TV.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Framework**: [Next.js 16](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) + Custom CSS Variables
- **State Management**: [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand)
- **Icons**: [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/)
- **Deployment**: Netlify

## 🚀 Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repo:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Pavithra-050606/Netflix-Clone.git
    cd Netflix-Clone
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the dev server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

4.  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy
Where most clones use heavy JS libraries for animations, I chose to utilize high-performance CSS transforms (`scale`, `translate`) with hardware acceleration. This ensures 60fps performance even on lower-end devices. I re-engineered the "hover-and-expand" mechanism to prevent layout shifts while maintaining context.
